* **Does Access Mean Success? Connection to Policy-Makers and Lobbying Success of Political Actors** _(Draft available on request)_ <br/>
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This article aims at understanding the policy-making process by examining the relationship between access to policy-makers and lobbying success. I collect unique large-scale textual data on the content of lobbying activities and their subsequent policy changes. I identify instances of lobbying success with two complementary approaches: one based on a plagiarism-detection algorithm and the other on GPT. I match this novel data with meetings held between policy-makers and interest representatives to measure access to policy-makers. It reveals notable disparities in access, with the business sector having more access to policy-makers than the civil society. Moreover, I find that access to policy-makers is associated with a higher likelihood of lobbying success, by 11 percent of one standard deviation. This increased success likelihood is larger for entities with more access, as measured by the number of meetings they have. Distinguishing access to policy-makers contemporaneously or before the discussions on a policy, I find that prior access to policy-makers is also associated with higher chances of success. It suggests that reputation and connection-building play a critical role. These results are driven by the business sector, composed of companies and business associations. It indicates that in addition to having more access to policy-makers and being better politically connected, companies and business associations derive greater benefits from these connections. In contrast, NGOs with access to policy-makers do not display an increased probability of success.

* **Revolving Doors in the European Union: Quantification and Consequences**, with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jeanne-bomare/about" target="_blank">Jeanne Bomare</a> _(Draft available on request)_

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This paper studies the impact of employee mobility between the European Union (EU) public sector and non-EU organizations on access to EU policymakers and EU funding. We use data from the professional network LinkedIn to identify moves across all EU hierarchy levels, both in the direction of entering and exiting the EU public sector. We identify more than 50,000 moves between 74 EU institutions and bodies and the private sector, over the 2014-2023 period. Using a dynamic difference-in-differences estimator accounting for multiple treatments, we find that hiring EU staff increases the probability of obtaining EU procurement contracts or EU grants by about 5%. Moves in the opposite direction have no effect on access to EU funding, suggesting that benefits of the hire derive from acquiring insider knowledge. Additionally, hiring Commission staff significantly boosts engagement with the Commission, with effects being particularly pronounced for moves of relatively long-term employees. Conversely, when private-sector employees transition to the Commission, organizations experience a similar 10% rise in meetings with the Commission. The symmetry of these results suggests that they are driven by the network gained through these moves.

* **Strategic Complementarity in NGO Advocacy: Evidence from the European Commission** _(Draft available on request)_
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This article analyzes the advocacy strategies of environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs). I develop a model in which ENGOs can engage in costly advocacy activities to foster pro-environmental policy changes on different dimensions. The model gives insights on their optimal advocacy strategies, and their reaction functions to lobbying from other actors. Combining data on meetings with European Commission members and textual analysis to measure lobbying efforts on different topics, I find support for strategic complementarity of ENGOs efforts. ENGOs also seem to drive the lobbying agenda of the business sector on environmental topics.
