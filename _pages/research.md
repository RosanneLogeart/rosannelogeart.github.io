* **Does Access Mean Success? Connection to Policy-Makers and Lobbying Success of Political Actors** _(Draft available on request)_ <br/>
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This article investigates the relationship between access to policymakers and lobbying success. I collect unique, large-scale textual data to capture the content of lobbying activities and subsequent changes in EU regulations. I identify lobbying success with both plagiarism detection and a large language model (GPT-4). I measure direct access to policymakers based on meetings between policy-makers and interest group representatives. To address potential endogeneity in access, I build a matched sample using propensity scores and a balanced sample using Mahalanobis distance. I find that access to policymakers is associated with a larger likelihood of lobbying success, consistent across success measures and samples. This effect is stronger for organizations that hold more meetings and for those with access to higher-level officials. Finally, I exploit turnover in policymakers across mandates to explore the underlying mechanisms and find evidence that political connections primarily drive the effect of access on success, surpassing the influence of information transmission, institutional knowledge, or intrinsic quality of the organization in driving lobbying success.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This paper studies the impact of employee mobility between the European Union (EU) public sector and non-EU organizations on access to EU policymakers and EU funding. We use data from the professional network LinkedIn to identify moves across all EU hierarchy levels, both in the direction of entering and exiting the EU public sector. We identify more than 50,000 moves between 74 EU institutions and bodies and the private sector, over the 2014-2023 period. Using a dynamic difference-in-differences estimator accounting for multiple treatments, we find that hiring EU staff increases the probability of obtaining EU procurement contracts or EU grants by about 5%. Moves in the opposite direction have no effect on access to EU funding, suggesting that benefits of the hire derive from acquiring insider knowledge. Additionally, hiring Commission staff significantly boosts engagement with the Commission, with effects being particularly pronounced for moves of relatively long-term employees. Conversely, when private-sector employees transition to the Commission, organizations experience a similar 10% rise in meetings with the Commission. The symmetry of these results suggests that they are driven by the network gained through these moves.

* **Strategic Complementarity in NGO Advocacy: Theory and evidence from the European Commission** _(Draft available on request)_
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This article analyzes the advocacy strategies of environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs). I develop a model in which ENGOs can engage in costly advocacy activities to foster pro-environmental policy changes on different dimensions. The model gives insights on their optimal advocacy strategies, and their reaction functions to lobbying from other actors. Combining data on meetings with European Commission members and textual analysis to measure lobbying efforts on different topics, I find support for strategic complementarity of ENGOs efforts. ENGOs also seem to drive the lobbying agenda of the business sector on environmental topics.

* **Choosing Legislative Power**, with <a href="http://www.davidfortunato.com" target = "_blank">David Fortunato</a> and <a href="https://fhollenbach.org" target = "_blank">Florian Hollenbach</a>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In democracies, elected representatives in legislatures compete with unelected bureaucrats for influence over policy outcomes. A determining factor in this competition is the legislature’s procedural organization and endowment of tangible resources for legislative work, both of which shape its overall capacity for policy design and oversight. Importantly, nearly every democratic legislature is empowered to choose its organizational rules and resource endowment, creating a fascinating strategic choice at the heart of each democratic system: how much capacity will the legislature grant itself? We present a theoretical model of this choice in light of the legislative majority’s present and expected orientation toward the bureaucracy, its preferential dissimilarity from the opposition, and its expectations for deselection. The model is parsimonious but rich, allowing us to better understand the historical development of legislatures as well as more recent institutional changes.

* **Legislative Capacity Across OECD Member States**, with <a href="http://www.davidfortunato.com" target = "_blank">David Fortunato</a> and <a href="https://fhollenbach.org" target = "_blank">Florian Hollenbach</a>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Legislatures vary in their capacity for detailed design and scrutiny of draft bills and oversight of the bureaucracy as a function of their formal powers and their endowment of tangible resources for legislative work. These resource endowments, such as member salaries, budgets for legislative staff, and session days, have been shown to be powerful predictors of interbranch interactions and legislative outcomes, but applied research is almost entirely limited to the study of (subnational) state governments in the US. We present new data on these resources for the national legislatures of OECD member states for the last several decades, documenting remarkable variability across units, as well as within-units over time. This variation in resource endowments presents substantial opportunity for new research in comparative political economy.
