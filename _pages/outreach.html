## Roundtables and Debates

### Qatargate: understanding the origins of the scandal and the challenges for a new lobbying framework.
  Event held by (GIS Euro-Lab)[https://gis-eurolab.fr/evenements/debats-et-controverses-qatargate-comprendre-origines-scandale-et-enjeux-dun-nouvel] on Friday 24 March 2023.
Discussion moderated by (Lola Avril)[https://lolaavril.com] (PhD in political science, research associate, University of Eastern Finland) and (CÃ©cile Robert)[https://triangle.ens-lyon.fr/spip.php?article807] (professor of political science, Sciences Po Lyon).
 
 
Since the arrest in December 2022 of a vice-president of the European Parliament, a former MEP, and a parliamentary assistant for "corruption", "money laundering" and "participation in a criminal organization", lobbying in the European Parliament and its regulation have taken center up the stage in political and media discourse. This round table of the "Controversies" conference series proposes to show how the academic disciplines gathered within the GIS Euro-Lab, which have long been interested in the role of interest groups in the functioning of the EU, can shed light on and give meaning to such an event and its political and institutional consequences. In this perspective, the aim is to look back at what the Qatargate scandal tells us about the ordinary functioning of lobbying in the European Parliament and the evolution of its practice over the last twenty years in Brussels. On the other hand, we will be interested in the reforms of its framework currently being debated in the Parliament, by underlining the contribution of a historical and comparative analysis attentive to their legal and political stakes.
