<p>I have built a number of databases to conduct my research. All will be available here, with associated documentation.</p>

<h3>Lobbying and Policy Changes in EU Regulations <i>(Available soon)</i></h3>

<p>Dataset covering 482 Commission Regulations from 2015 to 2023, including official drafts and the final adopted policy texts. I also provide a tool to filter policy-relevant content in the drafts and final texts, and to identify policy changes occurring during the policy-making process.
<br/>The dataset also includes the 129,153 comments from interest groups made on these drafts during the policy-making process. I link each comment with the characteristics on the entity writting it.
<br/>This dataset is useful for researchers studying policy-making processes, as well as for policy-makers.</p>
