<p>I have built a number of databases to conduct my research. All will be available here, with associated documentation.</p>

<h3>Lobbying and Policy Changes in EU Regulations <span style="font-weight:normal"><i>(Available soon)</i></span></h3>

<p>Dataset covering 482 Commission Regulations from 2015 to 2023, including their unique official draft and the final adopted policy text. I also provide a tool to filter policy-relevant content from the drafts and final texts, and to identify policy changes occurring during the policy-making process.
<br/>The dataset includes the 129,153 comments made on these drafts by interest groups and citizens during the policy-making process.
<br/>This dataset is useful for researchers studying policy-making processes or influence dynamics.</p>
