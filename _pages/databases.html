<p>I have built a number of databases to conduct my research. All will be available here, with associated documentation.</p>

<h3>Lobbying and Policy Changes in EU Regulations <span style="font-weight:normal"><i>(Available soon)</i></span></h3>

<p>Dataset covering 1,106 Commission Regulations from 2015 to 2025, including their unique official draft and final adopted policy text. I also provide a tool to filter policy-relevant content from drafts and final texts, and to identify policy changes between the draft and the final version of the text.
<br/>The dataset includes the 145,816 comments interest groups and citizens made on these drafts, before the elaboration of the final text.
<br/>This unique and comprehensive dataset is especially useful for researchers studying policy-making processes or the dynamics of influence.</p>
