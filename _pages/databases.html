<p>I have built a number of databases to conduct my research. All will be available here, with associated documentation.</p>

<h3>Lobbying and Policy Changes in EU Regulations <i>(Available soon)</i></h3>

<p>Dataset covering 482 Commission Regulations from 2015 to 2023, including official drafts and adopted texts. I also provide a tool to filter policy-relevant content and identify policy changes. The dataset also includes the 129,153 comments associated with each official drafts. I link each comment with characteristics on the entity.</p>
