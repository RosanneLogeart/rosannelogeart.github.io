Welcome to my website!
------

* I am a PhD Candidate at the Paris School of Economics ([PSE](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/)) and the [University Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr). My thesis advisor is [Mireille Chiroleu-Assouline](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/chiroleu-assouline-mireille/).

* I am currently a teaching fellow at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/). I visited [UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu) in 2022-2023.

* My research focuses on the role of **lobbying** in policy-making processes. In particular, I investigate how political connection or reputation relate to lobbying success. I also study the consequences of **revolving doors**.
