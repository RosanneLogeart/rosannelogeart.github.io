Welcome to my website!
------
  
* I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Money in Politics research group at the [Copenhagen Business School](https://www.cbs.dk/en){:target="_blank"}.

* I received my Ph.D. from the Paris School of Economics ([PSE](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"}) and the [University Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr){:target="_blank"}. I visited the Department of Economics at [UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu){:target="_blank"} in 2022-2023, and I was a Teaching and Research Fellow at the Department of Economics at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/){:target="_blank"} in 2023-2024.

* My research lies in the field of **political economy**, with a strong interest in **influence**. In particular, I investigate how much **information transmission** or **political connections** can explain lobbying success. I also study the impact of **revolving doors** and the choices of parliaments upon their **legislative capacity**. To conduct my research, I compile new data that I study with natural language processing tools.

* You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kwgoyTCs-K1QaPVD9JN_2dbvUhTeVCeQ/view?usp=share_link){:target="_blank"} and contact me at *rosanne.logeart(at)psemail.eu*.
